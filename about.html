        <h1 >About Us</h1>
        <h3 >The manager of a pharmacy is responsible for the running of various aspects of the pharmacy, such as finances, staff, marketing, sales, and customer service.Management should oversee the stock of pharmaceutical goods and other items for sale in the pharmacy. This is particularly important for prescription drugs and other controlled items (e.g. sharps), which should be checked more regularly. Most pharmaceutical suppliers make two deliveries daily, so replacements can be ordered and received quickly when the supply is low.Various roles and responsibilities are included in the role of pharmacy management. It can be difficult for one person to oversee all of these areas, particularly in larger pharmacies, and in such cases, our website has been particularly designed to help you out.</h3>
